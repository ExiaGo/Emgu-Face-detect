# Emgu-Face-detect

C# Face detect demo

This is a demo for face detect, and I use the VS2010 and Emgu.cv(the version is emgucv-windows-x86 2.4.0.1717).

First of all, you should download the emgu by google and install it.

Second you can make a WPF by VS2010 and just use MainWindow.xaml & MainWindow.xaml.cs files.

I think most of you are smart. So you can import file like this.

The important thing is please copy the dll files from emgu/bin/x86 to your project file ( bin/Debug ).

Finally, the impression drawing as follows.
